# The TypeScript Dilemma

If you've written TypeScript, you've probably faced the choice: `type` or `interface`? 

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

Historically, the differences were significant, but in modern TypeScript, they are nearly identical in capabilities. However, there are still a few key distinctions.

## When to Use Interfaces

Interfaces are incredibly powerful when you know your object shape might need to be augmented later.
- **Declaration Merging:** You can define an interface multiple times, and TypeScript will merge the declarations. This is heavily used by library authors (like extending the global `Window` object).
- **Object-Oriented Design:** If you are writing classes that need to follow a contract, `implements InterfaceName` is the standard pattern.

## When to Use Types

Types are more versatile. While interfaces can only describe object shapes, types can describe almost anything.
- **Unions and Intersections:** If you need a value to be one of many shapes (`type Status = 'success' | 'error'`), you *must* use `type`.
- **Utility Types:** When extracting or mapping types (like `Pick`, `Omit`, or `ReturnType`), types are required.

## The Verdict

For most React and Next.js applications, the choice is purely stylistic. Pick one standard for your codebase and stick to it. As a general rule of thumb: Use `interface` for public APIs and object shapes, and use `type` for complex type definitions, unions, and tuples.
