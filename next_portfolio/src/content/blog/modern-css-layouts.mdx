# The Great Layout Debate

For years, developers asked: "Should I use Grid or Flexbox?" The answer today is simple: **Use both.** 

While they share some similarities, they are designed for fundamentally different paradigms of layout.

## Flexbox: 1D Layouts

Flexbox is designed for **one-dimensional** layouts—either a row or a column. It excels at distributing space within a container and perfectly aligning items.

Use Flexbox when:
- You need to align a row of navigation links.
- You want to center an icon inside a button.
- You have a list of tags that should wrap naturally.

## CSS Grid: 2D Layouts

CSS Grid is designed for **two-dimensional** layouts—handling both rows and columns simultaneously.

Use Grid when:
- Building an entire page structure (Header, Sidebar, Main, Footer).
- Creating a gallery of images or a grid of product cards.
- You need strict control over overlapping elements.

```css
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  /* Auto-fit magic that replaces media queries */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 1.5rem;
}
```

## The Synergy

The most powerful layouts happen when you combine them. A perfect example is a dashboard: CSS Grid handles the macro-layout (the sidebar and main content area), while Flexbox handles the micro-layouts (the notification bell and user profile inside the header).
